Welcome to the Hintersea-Nusantara wiki!
The word hintersea is not standard, if we separate it into two words hinter-sea it can mean that ' the inland sea ' is suitable for its understanding, indeed if we combine the word it is a bit surprising it has no meaning, only inland~inland what? then you can separate it into 'hinter sea' this is not 'hinder sea' it will have a different meaning to block the sea. We can find this word thanks to the technology of interpreting HTML coding (Hypertext Markup Language) which is a markup language or standard code for creating and compiling pages and web applications. You can use this markup language for paragraphs, headings, or links on a web page. I actually learned this from 2008-2009 when I first started a blog.

Finally, let me use the word HINTERSEA in a single integration and I will _standardize_ it in this article as the first launch in my first article which I published through the github.com page.
Indonesian waters or the Archipelagic Sea in Oceania~a term that refers to a geographical or geopolitical area consisting of a number of islands located in the Pacific Ocean and its surroundings. Based on the 1831 French explorer Jules Dumont d'Urville although Magellan was the first to explore in the 1500s.
This ocean includes Polynesia (including New Zealand), Melanesia (including New Guinea) and Micronesia. In a broad sense, Oceania also includes Australia and Maritime Southeast Asia, which also includes the Malay Peninsula. However, sometimes Hong Kong, the Korean Peninsula, Japan, Taiwan, the Aleutian Islands, Sakhalin Island, the peninsula in northeastern Russia, and the Alaska Peninsula are also considered to be in the Oceania group. The Archipelago Sea can be called the same as the "Hintersea" of the archipelago, so far what is known is the hintersea Mediterranean here we also call it the Hintersea Nusantara because it is not only behind or within the geographical area of ​​​​the archipelago. The breadth of the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean, but oceanographically the depth of its waters contain a thrilling secret not only for oceanographers but for ordinary people in general.
To be continued.
